# The Few

Your sources. Your podcast. Every day.

The Few is a personal feed-to-podcast pipeline with one rule: **you define
the sources, nothing else gets in.** A background agent checks your sources
once a day, pulls their latest updates, and turns them into a podcast
episode — with the full script kept alongside the audio.

No recommendations. No trending tabs. No algorithmic feed. Just the people
and publications you chose, read to you.

## New here? Start in one sitting

Hand this repo to your agent (or a friend's) and answer six questions:
who to follow, any official blogs, how many episodes, how long, what
language, what the host is called. The full script is in
[`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](docs/ONBOARDING.md) — it includes recommended
starter packs (AI labs tracker, learning & thinking) you can paste
straight into `sources.yaml`.

## How it works

```
You define sources (sources.yaml)
        ↓  daily, automatic
Agent ingests each source's latest updates
        ↓
Updates → digest → single-host script → MP3 episode
        ↓
data/episodes/2026-09-28/research.mp3 (+ research-script.txt)
```

## Install

Prerequisites: Python 3.10+, `ffmpeg`, a TTS backend (see
`references/tts-backends.md`).

```bash
git clone <this-repo> the-few
cd the-few
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp examples/sources.yaml sources.yaml   # then edit: your sources
./scripts/run-daily.sh                  # run once now
```

Schedule it daily (cron example — 7:14 AM):

```cron
14 7 * * * /path/to/the-few/scripts/run-daily.sh >> /path/to/the-few/data/cron.log 2>&1
```

## Defining sources

`sources.yaml` is the whole product. Example:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: "3Blue1Brown"
    type: youtube
    channel: research
    handle: "3blue1brown"

  - name: "Ethan Mollick"
    type: rss
    channel: research
    feed_url: "https://www.oneusefulthing.org/feed"
```

Full schema: `references/source-schema.md`. Source types: `rss`,
`youtube`, `blog`, `x`, `linkedin`.

## For agents

This repo is a skill: `SKILL.md` is the agent-readable entry point.
Agents (Muse, or any agent that reads skills) can install, configure,
run, and extend the pipeline from these docs alone.

## Status

v0.1 — framework. Pipeline skeleton, source schema, script conventions,
and prompt templates are in place. Prompt quality for natural-sounding
episodes is the next iteration (see `references/prompts.md`).
