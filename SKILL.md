description: Turn user-defined sources into a daily podcast. The user declares the sources they care about (people, blogs, channels — never platforms' recommendations); a background agent ingests each source's latest updates once a day, digests them into units, composes a single-host script, and synthesizes an MP3 episode while keeping the script. Use when the user wants a personal feed-to-podcast pipeline, wants to define or change their sources, or wants to run, debug, or extend the daily digest.

# The Few

A personal feed-to-podcast pipeline. The user defines their sources; a
background agent does the rest, every day:

```
sources.yaml → ingest → digest → compose → synthesize → episode.mp3 + script.txt
```

## The contract

1. **User-defined sources only.** The pipeline never pulls from anything
   outside `sources.yaml`. No recommendations, no trending, no filler.
2. **Follow people, not platforms.** Each source is a person, author, or
   editorial voice — not an algorithmic feed.
3. **Daily, unattended.** Ingest runs on a schedule (cron). The agent
   needs no prompting once sources are defined.
4. **Podcast + script.** Every episode ships as audio *and* its full
   script. The script is the durable artifact; audio is the interface.
5. **Content only.** Episodes never explain how they were made, what the
   selection logic is, or the philosophy behind the pipeline.

## Quick start

1. Copy `examples/sources.yaml` to `sources.yaml` and list your sources.
   See `references/source-schema.md` for the full schema.
2. Run the daily pipeline:
   ```
   ./scripts/run-daily.sh --date 2026-09-28
   ```
   This ingests, digests, composes, and synthesizes one episode per
   channel. Outputs land in `data/episodes/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
3. Schedule it: add a cron entry calling `run-daily.sh` (see
   `references/scheduling.md`).

## Layout

- `SKILL.md` — this file; the agent-readable entry point.
- `sources.yaml` — (you create) the user's defined sources.
- `references/` — durable docs: architecture, source schema, script
  conventions, prompt templates, scheduling, TTS backend notes.
- `scripts/` — the pipeline: `ingest.py`, `digest.py`, `compose.py`,
  `synthesize.sh`, `run-daily.sh`.
- `examples/` — example `sources.yaml` and example episode output.
- `data/` — runtime outputs (units, scripts, episodes). Git-ignored.

## Pipeline stages

**ingest** (`scripts/ingest.py`): for each source in `sources.yaml`,
fetch new items since the last run (tracked in `data/state.json`).
Source types: `rss`, `youtube`, `blog`, `x`, `linkedin`. Types that need
credentials or login (`x`, `linkedin`) degrade gracefully — they log a
warning and skip, never fail the run. Output: `data/units/YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

**digest** (`scripts/digest.py`): dedupe by URL/id, drop empties, rank by
recency, group by channel. Output: `data/digested/YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

**compose** (`scripts/compose.py`): one single-host script per channel,
using the prompt template in `references/prompts.md`. Script conventions
in `references/script-conventions.md`. Output:
`data/episodes/YYYY-MM-DD/<channel>-script.txt`.

**synthesize** (`scripts/synthesize.sh`): text-to-speech via the
configured backend (see `references/tts-backends.md`). Output:
`data/episodes/YYYY-MM-DD/<channel>.mp3`.

## Conventions for agents working here

- Read `references/architecture.md` before changing the pipeline.
- Source schema changes go in `references/source-schema.md` first.
- Prompt improvements go in `references/prompts.md` — the pipeline
  reads prompts from there, not from code.
- Never commit `data/` or `sources.yaml` (personal). Commit
  `examples/` instead.
- Keep every stage independently runnable and its output inspectable.
  An agent should be able to re-run `compose` without re-running
  `ingest`.
